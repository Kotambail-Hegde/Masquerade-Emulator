# Masquerade Emulator


_This was just a hobby project that I started for fun, but was not able to put much effort because of my busy schedule._

_But still, the emulator tries to be as accurate as possible but since I don't have the actual hardware for any of the systems that I am trying to emulate, I was completely relying on other's research that I could readily find on discord, blogposts or other emulator specific wiki pages for implementing the corner cases. I personally have done very minimal 'original research' for these platforms._

_I have avoided referencing other emulator's source code and tried to only rely on online information as much as possible, but still had to rely on a few cycle accurate emulators (mentioned in credit section below) and tweak them to either extract debug logs or to run my own custom roms and analyse the behaviour._

# Supported Platforms

As of now, masquerade is only tested for windows platform. There are plans to port this to other platforms in near future.

# User Interface

## QT5
Not supported yet

## SDL2
Not supported yet

## OLC
* In **windows** platform, the standard "winAPI" based user interface can be used for accessing various options of the emulator.</br>
* In **non-windows** (and windows) platforms, an "inbuilt OLC specific" user interface is also provided. Windows user can hence use both interfaces and can toggle b/w "winAPI" or "inbuilt OLC specific" interfaces by pressing 'esc' or 'R' keys respectively.
